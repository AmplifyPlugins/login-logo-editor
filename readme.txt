== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is the best way to add a new WordPress login logo? =

This plugin requires the URL to the image file you wish to use as your WordPress login logo. You can get this URL easily by uploading an image to your WordPress media library the way you would upload any other image to your site. To do this:

1. From your WordPress Dashboard, click Media > Add New.
2. Use the media uploader to upload your logo.
3. Click the Edit link next to the newly uploaded logo file.
4. Next to the logo there will be a field called File URL - copy this URL. WordPress Login Logo URL
5. On your WordPress Dashboard, click Settings > Login Logo.
6. Paste the logo file URL in the first box.

= What dimensions should my WordPress Login Logo be? =
The image file should be 548 px wide and 126 px tall for WordPress versions prior to 3.8. For 3.8, please use an image file with dimensions of 80px wide and 80 px tall.

= Does my WordPress Login Logo have to be uploaded to my WordPress site? =
No. You can use this plugin to point to an image file on another website if you want to. For example, if you have an image uploaded to a cloud storage site, you can use the File URL on that site to display the image as long as the other site allows it. Some sites may not want you to link directly to files on their servers, so it is best to check with them first to make sure you are not violating any of their terms.

= What other settings can I change? =
You can change the following settings in your WordPress Dashboard by clicking Settings > Login Logo:
* The image file used as your login logo.
* The URL that your login logo directs you to when it is clicked.
* The Title text that displays when you hover your mouse over the login logo.
* Custom styles for the login page. Using CSS, you can edit the background, fonts, and other settings. If you are unfamiliar with CSS, simply leave this section blank.

== Screenshots ==
1. Customize the login screen however you want it to look. Use different fonts, change the background colors, fonts, and more!
